Styling and formatting issues 
* While adding a button to the handlebars page.  A random "Note" button appeared directly under the header "Today's News".  I couldn't figure out why this occured.  I manipulated the index.handlebars page for a while thinking that I misplaced the order of the html.  However, to no avail, the random "Note" button remained.  I realized that there was a space between the header and the text of the imbedded handlebars html.  This prompted me to take a look at the database because I realized that the structure of my code resulted in a button created after the title and hyperlink of the article.  This brought the notion of, I must have something in the first data entry slot in my mongo database. After checking the database, I forgot that I manually inserted through the terminal command line a piece of dummy data labeled, " "name":"Test" ".  I deleted this entry from the database and fixed this issue of the random floating button under the main heading.  

2.
Add an id to the div that holds the article title, url, and etc.

then create a CSS page for it and for that given id, make sure to add in the CSS page:
"display: flexbox;
